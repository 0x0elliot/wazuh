   - Active response enabled.
   
   - By default, we can enable the host-deny and the 
     and the firewall-drop responses. The first one 
     will add a host to the /etc/hosts.deny and the 
     second one will block the host on iptables (linux)
     or on ipfilter (Solaris, FreeBSD, etc).
   - They can be used to stop SSHD brute force scans, 
     portscans and some other forms of attacks. You can 
     also add them to block on snort events (for example).
     
   - Do you want to enable the host-deny response?(yes/no)y
