  - You have three installation options: agent, local or server.
  
    - If you choose server, you will be able to analyze all  
      the logs, create e-mail notifications and responses,   
      and also receive logs from remote syslog machines and  
      from systems running the 'agents' (where traffic is  
      sent encrypted).
      
    - If you choose the agent(client), you will be able to read
      local files (from syslog, snort, apache, etc) and forward
      them (encrypted) to the server for analysis.             

    - If you choose local, you will be able to do everything  
      the server does, except receiving remote messages from  
      the agents or external syslog devices      

  - Use 'server' if you are setting up a log/analysis server.
  
  - Use 'agent' if you have another machine to run as a log
    server and want to forward the logs to the server for analysis.
    (ideal for webservers, database servers ,etc)
    
  - Use 'local' if you are just have one system to analyze.
